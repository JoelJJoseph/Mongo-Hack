## Inspiration: ðŸ’¡
We all know how much the Palestinians have suffered lately, seeing the amount of tough time these refugees had to go through I arrived at the idea of Refug-Assist. The majority of the masses face a lot of financial crises due to forced immigration. Hence came up with the solution to provide a job portal that shall help these refugees get a job and live a decent life in the countries they have landed in.

Almost majority of the population out their face a problem of availing medical facilities let alone the consultation and due to this pandemic, many people were faced with problems such as transportation or unavailability of doctors to tend to their diseases, which sparked an idea in my minds to build a management system which not makes it cheap and affordable to the financially stricken people or people who need immediate information regarding what disease they are suffering from, but also help them identify the seriousness of the disease or cancer that's taken root in them. We were inspired by the many possibilities the latest tech like Image segmentation using Machine Learning can help us solve the impending problem that the people facing in this pandemic situation.
