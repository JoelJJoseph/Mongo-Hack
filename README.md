## Refug-Assist : Helping Refugees through Tech

## Inspiration: 💡
We all know how much the Palestinians have suffered lately, seeing the amount of tough time these refugees had to go through I arrived at the idea of Refug-Assist. The majority of the masses face a lot of financial crises due to forced immigration. Hence came up with the solution to provide a job portal that shall help these refugees get a job and live a decent life in the countries they have landed in.

Almost majority of the population out their face a problem of availing medical facilities let alone the consultation and due to this pandemic, many people were faced with problems such as transportation or unavailability of doctors to tend to their diseases, which sparked an idea in my minds to build a management system which not makes it cheap and affordable to the financially stricken people or people who need immediate information regarding what disease they are suffering from, but also help them identify the seriousness of the disease or cancer that's taken root in them. We were inspired by the many possibilities the latest tech like Image segmentation using Machine Learning can help us solve the impending problem that the people facing in this pandemic situation.

## How i built it ❓
I built this project in various languages like; CSS, Html, Node, Express, Javascript, Python(AI,ML)

## Challenges I ran into 🎢
The number of challenges that I faced was no joke, Time was a constraint as i had to schedule our time for this project from our day-to-day hectic schedule, during execution, there were errors where i had to focus on debugging them. The biggest obstacle that stood in front of me was in integrating Machine Learning, which we were able to pull of using python. Overcoming all the challenges we were able to create an outstanding innovative project which makes us proud of building it and some trouble with the code as well, but all of that apart we all feel very proud that overcame all those problems and created a beautiful website.
